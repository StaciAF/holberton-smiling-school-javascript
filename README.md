# 0x0F. Build a web app in JavaScript
**Description**
An alternate version of your final project. If you choose to do this, Kristen and I will be grading it so please send us the GitHub repo that you would like us to view. If you have the site running somewhere (hey, you can host it on a github.io site for fun), send us that link as well.

#### Task 0
Your project must have at least 3 HTML pages
You must use a styles.css file (and any relevant files/folders for images, fonts, etc.)
You must create an interactive Figma mockup for each page you want to design for both desktop and mobile
For this task, please write an amazing README.md
Interactions note:
Web pages must switch to the tablet version when the screen width is 768px
Web pages must switch to the mobile version when the screen width is 576px
button hover/active: opacity: 0.9

#### Task 1
This task has been changed to include all content you were asked to do in Task 2 and Task 3.
Create a landing page for your 3-page site.
You must use JQuery and Ajax requests.
A loader should be present when loading any dynamic content.
YOU get to pick where you are loading data, either from your own web server or an API you’ve found online that has interesting and relevant data to your 3-page site.
You must use a bootstrap carousel on this page that gets populated with dynamic content
You must include bootstrap cards that get populated dynamically with content and have either an image or a video (again, those images or videos must be populated dynamically)
Everything must be responsive and respect the tablet/mobile version sizes above
Here are some open APIs you could explore (or go find your own): https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis
All pages should be accessible from any other page
Example of a loader:
```
HTML:
<div class="loader"></div>

CSS:
.loader {
    border: 10px solid #f3f3f3;
    border-top: 10px solid #C271FF;
    border-radius: 50%;
    width: 80px;
    height: 80px;
    animation: spin 2s linear infinite;
    margin: auto;
}

@keyframes spin {
    0% { transform: rotate(0deg); }
    100% { transform: rotate(360deg); }
}
```

#### Task 2
Task 2’s content has been wrapped up into Task 1.

#### Task 3
Task 3’s content has been wrapped up into Task 1.

#### Task 4
Design a second page that is relevant page of your application
You must use JQuery and Ajax requests.
A loader should be present when loading any dynamic content.
YOU get to pick where you are loading data, either from your own web server or an API you’ve found online that has interesting and relevant data to your 3-page site.
Ideas for another page: Pricing, About, Contact, Events, Projects, News
All pages should be accessible from any other page

#### Task 5
Design a third page that is  relevant to your application
You must use JQuery and Ajax requests.
A loader should be present when loading any dynamic content.
YOU get to pick where you are loading data, either from your own web server or an API you’ve found online that has interesting and relevant data to your 3-page site
The API must have query parameters to allow for searching and sorting and your UI must allow the user to utilize the search/sort portions of that API to populate dynamic data. You could do this with dropdowns, search bars, etc.
The searching and sorting MUST happen with the API and not just with JavaScript on your client.
API requests must be done when the search value changes or the way data is sorted changes (done by the user on your UI somehow)
Ideas for another page: Pricing, About, Contact, Events, Projects, News
All pages should be accessible from any other page
